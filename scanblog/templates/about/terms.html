<h3>General</h3>
<p>
Welcome to Between the Bars (“BtB”).  BtB is a blog platform for prisoners
who have no or limited access to broadcast media.  Its mission is to facilitate
communication between prisoners and the public through our website available at
{{ base_url }} (“the Site”).
</p>

<p>
In order for BtB to operate this service effectively and responsibly, we have
created ground rules for using the Site, which are set out in this document
(the “Terms”).  By accessing, using, or contributing to the Site in any way,
you agree to abide by the Terms.  The Terms constitute a legally binding
Agreement between you and BtB.  
</p>

<p>
BtB may modify the Terms from time to time, at BtB’s discretion, and such
modifications shall be effective upon posting by BtB on the Site.  Your
continued use of the Site after BtB posts revised Terms signifies your
acceptance of the revised Terms.  It is therefore important that you review the
Terms regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes.  
</p>

<p>
We appreciate your understanding and are happy to answer any questions you have
about these Terms. 
</p>

<p>

MAKE NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, THAT THE BTB SITE, THE CONTENT ON THE

</p>
<p>
TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL BTB BE LIABLE
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE

such user or logging into a server or account which the user is not authorized
to access, (b) attempting to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system
or network or to breach security or authentication measures without proper
authorization, (c) attempting to interfere with service to any user, host or

</p>

<h3>Creating Profiles and Posting Comments</h3>
<p>
Accountholders can create user profiles by adding descriptions and/or uploading
photos.  They can also post comments to the prisoners’ letters.  You alone are
responsible for all content you add to the Site, including but not limited to
the information and photos in your profile and the content in your posts.  You
agree not to post content that includes any defamatory, abusive, obscene,
threatening or illegal material, or any other material that infringes on the
ability of others to enjoy the Site or that infringes on the rights of others.
</p>
<p>
BtB cannot and does not review every profile or posting made on the Site.  You
should expect the Site to include information and opinions from a variety of
individuals and organizations other than BtB.  BtB does not endorse or
guarantee the accuracy of any posting, regardless of whether the posting comes
from a prisoner, a web site user, a guest, or a member of our staff.
</p>
<p>
Although BtB cannot monitor all profiles and postings, BtB reserves the right
(though not the obligation) to delete, move, or edit any profile content or
postings for any reason whatsoever.
</p>
<h3>Transcription</h3>
<p>
An accountholder can prepare transcriptions of the prisoners’ posted letters.

errors.  You agree not to make changes to a transcription that is already
accurate.

accurately transcribing the content of the prisoner’s letter.  By making edits
to a transcription, you represent and warrant that the edits are accurate.  BtB
does not endorse or guarantee the accuracy of any transcription.
</p>

<p>
BtB reserves the right to lock transcription forms to prevent any further edits
to a prisoner’s letter.  BtB also reserves the right (though not the
obligation) to delete, move, or edit any transcriptions that BtB considers
unacceptable or inappropriate, whether for legal or other reasons.
