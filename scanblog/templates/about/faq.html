        Blogging can not only let people in prison tell their stories and
        report on their conditions, but it can also provide an instrumental
        role in maintaining "weak-tie" social networks (acquaintances and
        friends of friends), which are important for helping people
        <a href='http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.128.7760&rep=rep1&type=pdf'>to find jobs and communities in which to live</a>.  This can reduce recidivism.

    Aside from the postage to send us letters, the service is free.

    We don't believe so.  People in prison already have the ability to send letters,
    which are read and censored by prison officials on the way in and out.

    Prisoners maintain the copyrights to all of their writing.  If you'd like
    to republish it, you should ask them for permission.  You can do so by
    leaving a comment or, if they have provided an address, contacting them
    directly.
