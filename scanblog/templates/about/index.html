    <h1>About {{ site.name }}</h1>
    <p><a href='/'>{{ site.name }}</a> is a weblog platform for people in
    prison, through which the 1% of America which is behind bars can tell their
    stories.  Since people in prison are routinely denied access to the
    Internet, we enable them to blog by scanning letters.  We aim to provide a
    positive outlet for creativity, a tool to assist in the maintenance of
    social safety nets, an opportunity to forge connections between people
    inside and outside of prison, and a means to promote non-criminal
    identities and personal expression.  We hope to improve prisoner's lives,
    and help to reduce recidivism.
