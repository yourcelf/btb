Please find enclosed a printout of recent comments visitors have left on your
blog.  NEW: You can now reply directly to these comments, and the commenters
will get notified that you have replied.  Each set of comments has a unique
``reply ID'' which is included in the printout.  To respond directly, print the
reply ID of the comments you are responding to clearly at the top of your
letter.  Please remember that your responses are still public -- anyone on the
Internet can read them.  We also can't guarantee that the comment writers will
read or see your response; but we will do what we can to let them know that you
have responded.

Please keep in mind that we don't filter or censor these comments; nor
do we endorse them -- we just forward them on to you.  If there are comments
that you disagree with, please remember that there are all kinds of people on
the Internet, and while most are well intentioned, some may be less so.  The
best response to negative comments is usually no response.

Please remember that all information published using our service will be
completely public and listed under your full name; we ask you not to send us
anything illegal, incriminatory, or which might negatively affect your chances
for parole.

You can share the following Internet address (``URL'') to direct people to your
