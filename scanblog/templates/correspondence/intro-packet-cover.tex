We'd like to invite you to join \emph{Between the Bars}!

If you'd like to blog with us, please complete each item in the following checklist in order to get started (the checklist is for your use; no need to send it to us):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Read the {\bf Introductory Packet} which explains what Between the Bars is and how you can use it.  Decide if you're interested in writing with us.
\end{itemize}

\centerline{ {\bf \emph{If you'd like to use \emph{Between the Bars}, return the following to us:}} }

\begin{itemize}
    \item Review and sign the {\bf License Agreement}, and send it back to us.  We can't publish any materials from you until you've signed and returned it.
    \item If you'd like, send us a new {\bf blog post} and a {\bf profile page}!  Profile pages are a single 8.5x11 page in which you introduce yourself.  You may attach a photo or drawing if you like, add your mailing address, or anything else you'd like to tell people about yourself, as long as it fits on \emph{one page}.
\end{itemize}

We hope this answers any questions you might have, but if not, don't hesitate to write us.
